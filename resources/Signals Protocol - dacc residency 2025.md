Governance Token Voting Preference Intensity Coordination Decentralized Communities EGPL

## Abstract

As decentralized communities scale, they face a fundamental coordination bottleneck: traditional token voting captures choices but not intensity. This results in environments dominated by whales, late signaling cascades, and high noise in collective decision making. Signals introduces a board-based on-chain primitive that transforms preference intensity into structured, time-weighted support. Participants lock ERC-20 tokens for configurable durations, and each lock mints a transferable ERC-721 position that can be redeemed once an initiative succeeds or expires. This mechanism embeds explicit opportunity cost into governance and produces a continuously updating sensemaking surface where strongly held priorities rise naturally. During the residency, we formalized the governance dynamics behind Signals through the d/acc lens. We found that decay-bounded lock curves, immutable board configurations, and programmable acceptance thresholds can preserve pluralistic preferences while resisting capture. Optional incentive layers, including a multi-board participation pool and initiative-level bounties, reward early and accurate support and reduce the influence of last-minute behavior and apathetic equilibria. Field workshops demonstrated that these mechanisms maintain liveness under realistic network conditions and allow smaller holders to influence outcomes by committing for longer periods, which is a clear improvement over binary voting models. The residency also allowed us to soundboard the EGPL, an emerging open-source license designed for network economies. The EGPL aligns software incentives with public goods production by ensuring that downstream economic benefit returns to the network that maintains the infrastructure. Together with Signals and our other research directions, the EGPL contributes to a broader ecosystem of defensible, decentralized primitives for digital governance. Overall, our findings indicate that intensity-based locking offers a credible path toward scalable and resilient governance. The architecture supports decentralization, broad participation, and differential experimentation, although real-world performance depends on decay design, parameter selection, and incentive configuration. These results highlight the need for continued applied research.
