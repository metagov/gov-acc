## Deliberative Tools Gallery

## Do → Learn → Decide → (repeat)

We describe governance as a cycle of **doing** something, **learning** from how it went, **deciding** to undertake a change process, and returning to action under a new plan.

We describe the *Learn* and *Decide* portions as the “deliberative arc” portion of the loop.Based on the functions provided by the tools participating in the first interop cohort, we defined stages on this arc:

| Stage | Description |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Evaluating | reflecting on current conditions |  |
| Agenda setting | prioritizing, framing, identifying dimensions and stakeholders |  |
| Eliciting | self-reflecting on values, lived experience, and acquired knowledge |  |
| Learning | welcoming evidence or others’ lived experience, mapping arguments, graphing debates, steel manning, fact-checking |  |
| Deliberating | explaining yourself to others, being paraphrased to others, articulating values, arguing positions |  |
| Proposing | ideating solutions, forming proposals, modeling scenarios |  |
| Deciding | ranking, voting, integrating objections, consenting |  |
| Actuating | taking a decision and making it happen, tracking status |  |
