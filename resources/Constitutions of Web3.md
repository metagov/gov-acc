*This site presents preliminary analysis from the Constitutions of Web3 data set. If you belong to a DAO or Web3 community, [drop your constitution here](https://metagov.typeform.com/addconstitution).*

To the People of the Web:

After an unequivocal experience of the ineffectiveness of the subsisting institutions of the internet, you are called upon to create a new Constitution for a decentralized autonomous organization.

Decentralized autonomous organizations contain a particular promise: the ability to solve old coordination problems through ‘smart contracts' that encode constitutional rights. **Although smart contracts are promising new tools for governance, they alone cannot govern communities; traditional constitutions and declarations of rights are still crucial for good governance.**

Accordingly, we have created a number of materials to aid in your pursuit of a new Constitution. The first is an [analysis of DAO constitutions](https://constitutions.metagov.org/article). This article examines professed rights and values and places DAO constitutions in context with digital constitutions more broadly.

The second is a [data set of DAO constitutions](https://github.com/metagov/constitution-template/tree/main/constitutions). We expect the analysis and data set to be of interest to scholars and practitioners seeking a broader perspective on DAO constitutions.

The third is a [guide to creating constitutions](https://constitutions.metagov.org/guide). From our analyses of constitutions and interviews with constitution authors, we present recommendations for beginning to draft a constitution. We hope for this to be useful for organizations considering constitutions or in the early stages of drafting.

Alongside the guide is a [minimal constitutional template](https://constitutions.metagov.org/template). When combined with the guide and our [data set of constitutions](https://github.com/metagov/constitution-template/tree/main/constitutions), we expect this template to be helpful when at the earliest stages of constitution creation.

May the lessons of the past continue to guide the growth of the future.![Metagov Logo](https://constitutions.metagov.org/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmetagov.034c1842.png&w=96&q=75)
