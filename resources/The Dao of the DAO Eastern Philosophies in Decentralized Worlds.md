### Abstract

In chapter 62 of Daodejing, Laozi describes the Dao as "the hearth and home of the ten thousand things. Good souls treasure it, lost souls find shelter in it." Contemporary DAOs are often framed within Western discourses of decentralization, autonomy, and Web 3.0 innovation. However, emerging practices-especially in Chinese-speaking communities-reveal a distinctive layer of cultural imagination deeply rooted in Eastern thought. This research proposes to understand DAOs from Eastern philosophies by examining how Daoist principles inform the values and practices of DAO communities in Asia to articulate alternative visions of autonomy, community, and social organization. Concepts such as wú-wéi (non-action) and xiāo-yáo (carefree wandering) are increasingly referenced in the context of blockchain governance in the East. Using SeeDAO, a prominent DAO in the Chinese-speaking Web3 space, as a focal point, this study will explore how concepts such as non-action governance, the "Dao follows nature", and "emergence" are operationalized in digital governance practices. The research seeks to make three key contributions: first, to elucidate the lived experiences and ethical visions of DAO participants in China; second, to provide a culturally grounded theory of decentralized governance rooted in Eastern philosophical paradigms; and third, to explore how ancient philosophical ideas find renewed life in emergent socio-technical forms.
