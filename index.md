## Overview
gov/acc is a research program focused on accelerating governance innovation and experimentation in web3 communities. As part of the broader https://vitalik.eth.link/general/2025/01/05/dacc2.html, we believe that better governance infrastructure is essential for building coordination mechanisms that can solve critical problems in novel ways.

This program is conducted in public, with the hope of encouraging more data sharing, collaborative learning, and open research beyond what any single organization could achieve alone. We're building in the open to make governance innovation more accessible, participatory, and impactful.

Read the introduction: [gov/acc: Accelerating Governance Innovation in Web3](https://medium.com/@eugene.leventhal/gov-acc-accelerating-governance-innovation-in-web3-31309f06ab63)

Our work begins with:

- Producing an initial web3 governance research roadmap, which will be presented at the first gov/acc workshop around https://ethcc.io/
- Writing a revised [Open Problems in DAOs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19201) centered around industry problems
- Experimenting with and documenting the use of relevant deliberative, governance, and other relevant tooling
- Building a community of practioners and researchers who are looking to collaborate in 2026
- Seeing what emerges as we go

## Projects & Working Groups

### Research Roadmap

A systematic effort to map the landscape of governance challenges in web3 and identify potential solution pathways. Through structured activities in January and February 2025, we're working to:

- Source and categorize key governance problems from practitioners and researchers
- Develop a tech tree roadmap showing problem dependencies and solution approaches
- Document who is working on what, identifying gaps and collaboration opportunities
- Create a shared resource for the community to understand the governance innovation landscape

### Methodology

We're using a combination of interviews, surveys, and collaborative mapping sessions to gather input from diverse stakeholders. The methodology is being developed in parallel with the research itself.

### Resources

- Working Methodology Document (in development)
- Public mapping sessions and workshops (scheduled for Jan-Feb 2025)

## Open Problems in DAOs - Industry Focus Edition

Building on the original Open Problems in DAOs paper, this revision will shift focus toward practical industry challenges facing governance practitioners today.

While the original paper provided an academic foundation for understanding DAO research questions, this version will center on the operational, technical, and coordination problems that organizations actually face when implementing decentralized governance. The goal is to bridge academic research with practitioner needs.

### Collaboration

This project involves several authors from the original paper and will incorporate findings from the governance problem mapping exercise.

### Status

Scoping and planning phase. Expected to begin active research in Q1 2025.
